    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to store course data. A top-level `courses` collection stores course information. This structure is simple and scalable for future enhancements.\n\n**Authorization Independence:** Since there are no explicit authorization requirements mentioned in the prompt (e.g., user-specific courses, collaborative courses), the structure doesn't require denormalization for authorization. If, in the future, courses need to be owned by users or have specific access controls, the `Course` documents will need to denormalize relevant authorization data.\n\n**QAPs:**\n*   The segregation of course data into a single collection (`courses`) ensures that all documents share the same security requirements. This simplifies the security rules and ensures that listing courses can be done securely.\n*   If user-specific data is added later, path-based ownership or membership maps will be used to provide Authorization Independence and enable secure listing of user-specific data."
